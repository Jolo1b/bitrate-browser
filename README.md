The application may look better in the pictures because powershell 7 was used and not windows powershell 5.1.3 which is pre-installed on windows. 

This is due to the fact that the application uses windows forms to render the gui.

### EXE file
- warning: exe file will look even worse!

- Before running, scan the exe file with antivirus because windows defender won't like it.
