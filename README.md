# bitrate getter

Is an application for windows that can find out the bitrate of all mp3 files in the selected folder (and its subfolders).

The application may look better in the pictures because powershell 7 was used and not windows powershell 5.1.3 which is pre-installed on windows. 

This is due to the fact that the application uses windows forms to render the gui.

warning: exe file will look even worse!
